# Rafters

**Rafters** is a library for React that enables the serialization and deserialization of component trees to and from JSON. This allows you to store a component tree in a database and later restore it for rendering. With support for callbacks and scoped variables, Rafters simplifies the creation of dynamic, data-driven user interfaces.

Common use cases include:

- User-defined form builders.
- Dynamic page editors.
- Interactive dashboards.
- Reusable UI templates.

---

## Installation

Install Rafters using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install rafters
```

or

```bash
yarn add rafters
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Register Components

To use Rafters, you need to register the components you want to include in your schemas. This should be done **outside of any React component**. The recommended approach is to call `createRafters` in a separate module file and export the result. This ensures the registration is reusable across your application and gets cached in the application's bundle:

```typescript
// rafters.js
import { createRafters } from 'rafters';

const Rafters = createRafters({
  AppLayout,
  PageLayout,
  Heading,
  Form,
  TextField,
  SelectField,
});

export default Rafters;
```

You can then import and use `Rafters` wherever needed:

```typescript
import Rafters from './rafters';
```

### 2. Defining and Rendering Component Trees

#### Defining Component Trees

Component trees are defined using a builder function provided by Rafters. The `schema` property of the `Rafters.Renderer` component accepts either a prebuilt schema object (a JSON tree) or a callback function that receives the builder as an argument. Hereâ€™s an example of defining a component tree inline:

```typescript
import Rafters from './rafters';
import { useState } from 'react';

const InlineApp = () => {
  const [_formData, setFormData] = useState({});

  return (
    <Rafters.Renderer
      schema={(Builder) =>
        Builder.AppLayout({
          children: [
            Builder.PageLayout({
              heading: Builder.Heading({ children: 'My Form' }),
              children: [
                Builder.Form({
                  onSubmit: (data) => setFormData(data),
                  children: [
                    Builder.TextField({ label: 'Name', name: 'name' }),
                    Builder.SelectField({
                      label: 'Favourite Colour',
                      name: 'colour',
                      options: [
                        { label: 'Red', value: 'red' },
                        { label: 'Green', value: 'green' },
                        { label: 'Blue', value: 'blue' },
                      ],
                    }),
                  ],
                }),
              ],
            }),
          ],
        })
      }
    />
  );
};
```

#### Serialized Tree Example

When serialized, the tree from the above example produces the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "AppLayout",
  "props": {
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "PageLayout",
        "props": {
          "heading": {
            "type": "Heading",
            "props": { "children": "My Form" }
          },
          "children": [
            {
              "type": "Form",
              "props": {
                "onSubmit": {
                  "type": "Callback",
                  "code": "function (data) { setFormData(data); }"
                },
                "children": [
                  { "type": "TextField", "props": { "label": "Name", "name": "name" } },
                  {
                    "type": "SelectField",
                    "props": {
                      "label": "Favourite Colour",
                      "name": "colour",
                      "options": [
                        { "label": "Red", "value": "red" },
                        { "label": "Green", "value": "green" },
                        { "label": "Blue", "value": "blue" }
                      ]
                    }
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `onSubmit` callback is serialized as a stringified function inside an object with the type `Callback`.

#### Rendering a Serialized Tree

To render a serialized schema, pass it to the `Rafters.Renderer` component as the `schema` prop:

```typescript
const SerializedApp = () => {
  return <Rafters.Renderer schema={serializedSchema} />;
};
```

---

### 3. Using Scoped Variables

If the component tree depends on external variables, you can pass these variables to the `Renderer` through the `scope` property. This ensures the deserialized tree has access to them during rendering:

```typescript
const SerializedAppWithScope = () => {
  const [_formData, setFormData] = useState({});

  return (
    <Rafters.Renderer
      scope={{ setFormData }}
      schema={serializedSchema}
    />
  );
};
```

---

### 4. Defining Trees Outside of the Rendered Context

When defining a component tree in a separate context (e.g., for database seeds), any variables that will eventually be passed to the `scope` property must be declared in the scope where the tree is defined. These variables do not need to have assigned values but must be declared to satisfy TypeScript:

```typescript
const setFormData: Dispatch<SetStateAction<string | undefined>>;

const schema = createSchema((Builder) =>
  Builder.AppLayout({
    children: [
      Builder.PageLayout({
        heading: Builder.Heading({ children: 'My Form' }),
        children: [
          Builder.Form({
            onSubmit: (data) => setFormData(data),
            children: [
              Builder.TextField({ label: 'Name', name: 'name' }),
              Builder.SelectField({
                label: "Favourite Colour",
                name: "colour",
                options: [
                  { label: "Red", value: "red" },
                  { label: "Green", value: "green" },
                  { label: "Blue", value: "blue" }
                ]
              }),
            ],
          }),
        ],
      }),
    ],
  })
);
```

This ensures TypeScript recognizes the variables, even if they are only provided during rendering.
